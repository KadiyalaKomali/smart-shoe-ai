Smart Shoe for Visually Impaired â€“ Report

Abstract:
This project presents the design and development of a wearable smart shoe system aimed at assisting visually impaired individuals. The solution integrates sensors, Bluetooth, and cloud computing with a mobile and web dashboard to provide obstacle detection, real-time alerts, and location tracking.

Keywords:
Smart Shoe, Visually Impaired, IoT, Bluetooth, Firebase, Flutter, ESP32, Dashboard

1. Introduction:
Navigational challenges for visually impaired individuals are critical. This smart shoe integrates ultrasonic sensors with ESP32 to detect obstacles and wirelessly send alerts to a Flutter mobile app. Alerts are also logged on Firebase and visualized using a Flutter Web dashboard.

2. System Design:
- ESP32 microcontroller with ultrasonic sensor
- Bluetooth communication to Flutter app
- Firebase Realtime Database for data storage
- Web dashboard for caretakers/family

3. Technologies Used:
- ESP32, Ultrasonic Sensor, Bluetooth
- Flutter (Mobile & Web)
- Firebase (Realtime DB)
- Arduino IDE

4. Implementation:
- Arduino code measures distances and sends alerts
- Flutter app connects via Bluetooth and logs data to Firebase
- Web dashboard fetches and displays the log in real-time

5. Future Enhancements:
- GPS integration
- Fall detection
- Voice guidance
- AI-based obstacle classification

6. Conclusion:
This low-cost, smart footwear aids in safe navigation and real-time tracking, enhancing the mobility and safety of visually impaired users.
